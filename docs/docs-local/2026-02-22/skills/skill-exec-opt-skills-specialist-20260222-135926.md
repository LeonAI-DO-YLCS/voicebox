## Execution Details

### Path Selection Rationale

Primary MCP execution path was not used for this run; local execution was used directly in the project workspace to complete git operations and generate the required report artifact.

### Steps Executed

1. Pre-flight checks: validated workspace path, current branch, git remote, and working tree state. Also checked task-readiness reference file presence.
2. Observed readiness-doc gap: `docs/research/task-specification-standards-prd.md` not present.
3. Staged all changes with `git add -A`.
4. Created commit: `feat: improve recording UI/UX lifecycle, progress, and task visibility` (`f204538`).
5. Pushed branch to GitHub: `origin/feature/recording-ui-ux-improvements`.
6. Created this execution report at the required docs-local path.

### Execution Time

Total: ~57s

## Errors (if any)

### Error Message

None blocking.

### Context

- Path attempted: Local fallback workflow
- Environment: `/home/lnx-ubuntu-wsl/LeonAI_DO/dev/voicebox` on branch `feature/recording-ui-ux-improvements`
- Fallback attempted: Yes (local path used by design)

### Troubleshooting

- Optional follow-up: add the missing readiness reference file (`docs/research/task-specification-standards-prd.md`) if required by future strict pre-flight checks.
