2. Grouped changes into commit phases by category.
3. Committed backend model/policy/test changes.
4. Committed native Tauri audio capture and platform bridge changes.
5. Committed frontend UX/error handling and voice profile flow changes.
6. Committed tooling/build/dev-launch/uv migration script changes.
7. Committed documentation and OpenSpec artifact updates.
8. Verified clean git status.

### Execution Time

Total: ~8m 20s
